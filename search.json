You need a mixture of arm strength, accuracy, mobility, confidence, awareness, and so many other traits to be sustainable at the highest level of the sport. Year after year college prospects declare for the NFL draft, submitting their name into a pool of players to hopefully be selected to an NFL team. Each year, this pool of players typically contains a few high profile quarterbacks that are slated to be taken with high overall, or first-round picks.\nFor instance, in this years 2023 NFL Draft, Alabama QB, Bryce Young was taken with the #1 overall pick that was held by the Carolina Panthers. Ohio State QB, CJ Stroud, would then be selected #2 overall by the Houston Texans, as well as Anthony Richardson at #4 by the Indianapolis Colts. The Panthers, Texans, and Colts really have no idea how successful these young quarterbacks will be, but they are willing to roll the dice and give up assets at a chance to find the next Patrick Mahomes.\nIn this study, I will be looking at every quarterback taken within the first round of the draft since 2010. I will then be looking out how their playing careers have taken course over the last 13 years, and finally I will be ranking every quarterback in order of best to worst.\nI have excluded first round quarterbacks from this year’s (2023) NFL draft because they have not played yet, as well as Kenny Pickett from the 2022 NFL draft, mainly due to the fact that it is too early to tell their success level when having played barely any games.\nI will be evaluating the regular season passing data from each quarterback that meets the eligibility requirements for this study. The first and most basic thing I wanted to look at was touchdown to interception ratio. This gives us a fair assessment of accuracy and decision making while on the field. Keep in mind that some quarterbacks have played more games than others because of their age. I decided to keep some of the data that may appear as skewed, like games played, but on the other hand I included them to show that some quarterbacks were so bad that they didn’t even play a full season.\n\n\nCode\n qbdata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/qbsdata.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nqblong &lt;- qbdata %&gt;% select (Name, TD, INT) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Name, names_to = \"Type\", values_to = \"TD\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(qblong, aes(x=reorder(Name, TD), weight=TD, fill=Type)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Touchdown to Interception Ratio\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    title = \"Touch Down to Interception Ratio\",\n    subtitle = \"The lighter the color, the better the ratio\",\n    source = \"ESPN\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand the chart above, the length of the bar is each quarterbacks total touchdowns in their career. The color of each bar shows their career interceptions on a color range of blue (good), to black (bad). It is clear that Ryan Tannehill has a large number of touchdowns as well as a low number of interceptions in ratio. But at the same time, Ryan Tannehill has the most games played on this list so that must be taken into consideration.\nThis data may look skewed but obviosuly the longer the quarterback has been in the league, the more touchdowns they are going to throw. At the same time, the data is not skewed because there are quarterbacks like Johnny Manziel, EJ Manuel, Brandon Weeden, Jake Locker, and Christian Ponder that were still taken with high overall picks in the first with expectations to be long-time starters.\nThis data shows that even with the highest expectations that not every quarterback will succeed. On the other hand you have more recently drafted quarterbacks Like Trey Lance who was drafted #3 overall with the expectations to sit behind Jimmy Garoppolo for a year and take over the reigns as the starter the following season.\nNow lets take a look at completion percentage. Completion percentage shows good decision making, awareness, and accuracy from the quarterback position. To examine, here is a scatter plot chart that shows each quarterbacks career attempted passes to completions.\n\n\nCode\n qbrank &lt;- read_csv(\"qbsrank.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nPaxton_Lynch &lt;- qbdata %&gt;%\n  filter (Name == \"Paxton Lynch\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nTim_Tebow &lt;- qbdata %&gt;%\n  filter (Name == \"Tim Tebow\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nCam_Newton &lt;- qbdata %&gt;%\n  filter (Name == \"Cam Newton\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRyan_Tannehill &lt;- qbdata %&gt;%\n  filter (Name == \"Ryan Tannehill\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\ngeom_point(data = qbdata, aes(x = Completions, y = Attempts ), color = 'grey') +\n  geom_point(data = Paxton_Lynch, aes(x = Completions, y = Attempts), color = 'navy') +\n  geom_point(data = Tim_Tebow, aes(x = Completions, y = Attempts), color = 'orange') +\n  geom_point(data = Cam_Newton, aes(x = Completions, y = Attempts), color = 'blue') +\n  geom_point(data = Ryan_Tannehill, aes(x = Completions, y = Attempts), color = 'red') +\n  geom_text(aes(x=275, y=100, label=\"Paxton Lynch\"),size=2.5, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=0, y=500, label=\"Tim Tebow\"),size=2.5, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2682, y=4700, label=\"Cam Newton\"),size=2.5, color=\"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x=3000, y=4300, label=\"Ryan Tannehill\"),size=2.5, color=\"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Completion Percentages for First Round QB's Since 2010\",\n       subtitle = \"More attempts, more completions\",\n       x = \"Completions\", y = \"Attempts\",\n       caption = \"By: Jon Melau | Source: ESPN\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 3000)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.jpg\")\n\n\nIt is obvious that Ryan Tannehill and Cam Newton have more completions and attempts because they have been in the league a lot longer than most quarterbacks on this list. Something to point out though is that Paxton Lynch was drafted in the first round of the 2016 NFL Draft, and Tim Tebow was selected in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft. Tebow would go on to only be active for 35 games over the course of his 3 year playing career.\nFor how electrifying of a player Tebow was at the University of Florida, it is fair to say that he was a bust. Tebow has not been an active quarterback since 2013 as his job was taken from him by arguably a top 4 quarterback of all time, Peyton Manning.\nPaxton Lynch on the other hand would go on to become the first player in history to be benched in the NFL, XFL, USFL and CFL. Lynch was taken witht the 26th pick in 2016, so it’s fair to call him a bust, but the Broncos were definitely reaching with this pick, while simultaneously not losing too many assets at the 26th pick.\nAfter combining basic stat reading, it was time to create the rankings list of all of the quarterbacks accounted for in this study. Some things that I took into account in this list that arent’t represented in my data were rushing statistics, playoff success, times sacked, and accolades. Here is my personal rankings:\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=qbrank, aes(x=reorder(Name, Rank), weight=Rating), fill= \"green\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"From Worst to First\",\n    subtitle = \"Ranking every first-round quarterback since 2010 from bust to super star\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Efficiency Rating\",\n    caption = \"ESPN | By: Jon Melau\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is certainly one player that through all categories runs away with the #1 ranking on this list, and that is Patrick Mahomes from the Kansas City Chiefs. Two Super Bowl victories, two Super Bowl MVP’s, two regular season MVP’s, offensive player of the year and two passing yards/touchdown titles alone are enough to solidify Mahomes as the best first round quarterback since 2010.\nI would like to also include some love for Cam Newton. Newton was one of the most dominant players in the NFL for a 5 years span where there were some insanely good defenses in the NFC. He lead his team to a 15-1 record in 2015, but ended up losing in the Super Bowl. He holds the record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history and had a hell of an arm. People like to hate on him now, but forget how incredible he was in the early 2010’s. Oh yah, and he is only one of three players on this list with an MVP.\nIt was tough chosing a last place in this list, but I think it is pretty clear that the Arizona Cardinals really fumbled the bag when drafting Josh Rosen at #10 in 2018, especially considering Lamar Jackson went #32 to the Baltimore Ravens later that night. To be fair, it wasn’t the Cardinals fault, Rosen seemed like the real deal coming out of UCLA. 7 teams in 5 years, and out of the league before hes 27 is a tough look for a top ten pick.\nIt may seem that I am being harsh on Zach Wilson as well but he may have had one ov the worst starting quarterback seasons the NFL has ever seen. He has the lowest completion percentage on this list and that’s saying a lot considering he has only started not even a full season worth of games. But the Jets definitely got fleeced taking him with the #2 overall pick.\nThere are a few more contorversial rankings but for the most part I beleive it to be a fair list."

    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs punter Tommy Townsend was awarded 2022 NFL AP First Team All-Pro at the punter position. Some would regard First Team All-Pro as being at the pinnacle of your position when it comes to productiveness and skill level. 50 members of the Associated Press vote on who receives this prestigious award. Townsend received over half (28/50) of the votes for First Team All-Pro. Townsend becomes the first Chiefs punter to receive first team honors, alongside teammates Patrick Mahomes (QB) and Travis Kelce (TE).\nTownsend being selected to first team honors left a sour taste in the mouths of some members of the media. Fans on twitter were outraged with the decision to select Townsend over the likes of rookie punter Ryan Stonehouse, who broke the NFL’s oldest single-season record in 2022. The Tennessee Titans punter averaged 53.1 yards per punt during the regular season, allowing him to set the single season record. Stonehouse smashed the previous record of 51.4 yards, set by Sammy Baugh in 1940.\nStonehouse actually received 13 votes for first team honors, but with Townsends 28 votes there was not much of a race.\nAlthough records stand until they are broken, Super Bowl Champions are engraved forever. The Kansas City Chiefs would go on to win Super Bowl LVII with a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. On the other hand, Tennessee was knocked out of the NFL Playoffs in a week 18 nail-biting loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, who walked away with the division title. The Titans finished the 2022 season with a record of 7-10, while the Kansas City Chiefs finished with a record of 14-3.\nPlayers, coaches, and fans of the NFL know how integral special teams is to the success of a football team. Special teams is the easiest facet of the game to make mistakes in, as it is also one of the most important ways to help your team win a game. The question being asked here is, “how important was Tommy Townsend to the success of the Kansas City Chiefs this season, and did Ryan Stonehouse get snubbed from first team honors because of team success?”\nFirst we want to take a look at individual stats and how these two punters compare to the rest of the punters in the NFL. Are these really the two punters that should be in the running for AP First Team All-Pro simply based solely on the numbers that they produced?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(labeling)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\n\nCode\npunting_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/PuntingData1.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 34 Columns: 19\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (5): Player, Tm, Pos, TB%, In20%\ndbl (14): k, Age, G, GS, Pnt, Yds, Y/P, RetYds, Net, NY/P, Lng, TB, In20, Blck\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nTommy_Townsend1 &lt;- punting_data %&gt;%\n  filter (Player == \"Tommy Townsend\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRyan_Stonehouse1 &lt;- punting_data %&gt;%\n  filter (Player == \"Ryan Stonehouse\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\ngeom_point(data = punting_data, aes(x = `Y/P`, y = `In20%`), color = 'grey') +\n  geom_point(data = Tommy_Townsend1, aes(x = `Y/P`, y = `In20%`), color = 'red') +\n  geom_point(data = Ryan_Stonehouse1, aes(x = `Y/P`, y = `In20%`), color = 'blue') +\n  geom_encircle(data = Tommy_Townsend1, aes(x = `Y/P`, y = `In20%`), s_shape = 0, expand = -0.15, color = \"gold\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 350, y = 32, label = \"Tommy Townsend: Pin-point Accuracy,\\nRyan Stonhouse: Hitting Bombs\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=52, y=21.8, label=\"Tommy Townsend\"),size=2.5, color=\"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x=54.5, y=12, label=\"Ryan Stonehouse\"),size=2.5, color=\"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"TOMMY TOWNSEND IS THE MOST WELL-ROUNDED PUNTER\",\n       subtitle = \"But Stonehouse has the bigger leg\",\n       x = \"Yards per Punt\", y = \"% of Punts Inside of the 20\",\n       caption = \"By: Jon Melau | Source: Pro Football Reference\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(40, 55)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTommy Townsend appears to be the most efficient in these two categories. The reason that percentage of punts inside of the 20-yard-line was used as the y-axis is mainly due to the fact that field position plays a large role in the percentage of teams scoring points. According to PHDFootball, teams that are 1 yard away from the endzone have a 95% chance of scoring any points, and an 85% chance of scoring at least a field goal. As the yardage moves more in the negative, the lower the percentage of scoring gets.\nAlthough being naturally good at punting is going to translate into special team success, as well as overall team success, having a good supporting cast will inevitably lead to winning games. The main factor that separates Townsend from Stonehouse was the amount of times each of them had to punt. The Kansas City Chiefs ended up as the highest scoring offense in the NFL in 2022 (29.2 PPG), so it wasn’t much of a surprise that Tommy Townsend only punted 53 times all year (26th out of 36). On the flip side, the Tennessee Titans finished 27th in scoring (17.5 PPG), causing Stonehouse to punt a league high 90 times. Most would think that punting this many times would actually lower your average yards per punt, but Tennessee was so bad at moving the ball down the field, that they found themselves punting from deep in their own territory on almost every 4th down.\n\n\nCode\nPunts_Per_Week &lt;- read_csv(\"data/puntsperweek.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nTommy_Townsend &lt;- Punts_Per_Week %&gt;%\n  filter (Player == \"Tommy Townsend\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRyan_Stonehouse &lt;- Punts_Per_Week %&gt;%\n  filter (Player == \"Ryan Stonehouse\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Tommy_Townsend, aes(x=Week, y=Punts), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_line(data=Ryan_Stonehouse, aes(x=Week, y=Punts), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=9, y=0, label=\"Bye Week\"),size=2.5, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=5, y=0, label=\"Bye Week\"),size=2.5, color=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly offensive success rate plays a major role in the amount of times a punter is on the field. To say the least, it is impressive that Stonehouse was able to break this long-lasting record considering leading the league in punts.\nAnother big factor that must be looked at is punt net yards per punt. Yes, Stonehouse had the most punts, most yards, and the highest average yards per punt, but when you look deeper, Tommy Townsend led the league in punt net yards per punt. This is mainly in part of the Chiefs special teams being an elite unit and being able to cover punts very well. At the same time you have to take hang time into account where the punt team is given more time to get to the returner.\n\n\nCode\npunting_data2 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/PuntingData2.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nTommy_Townsend2 &lt;- punting_data %&gt;%\n  filter (Player == \"Tommy Townsend\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nRyan_Stonehouse2 &lt;- punting_data %&gt;%\n  filter (Player == \"Ryan Stonehouse\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=punting_data2, aes(x=reorder(Player, `NY/P`), weight=`NY/P`), fill= \"grey\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"TOMMY TOWNSEND HAD A GREAT SUPPORTING CAST\",\n    subtitle = \"The Chiefs special teams unit covered punts very well\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Net Yards per Punt\",\n    caption = \"Pro Football Reference | By: Jon Melau\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter taking in all of this data, it is clear that the all around talent and success of the Kansas City Chiefs allowed Tommy Townsend to be noticed as the best punter in the NFL, according to the AP First Team All-Pro awards. We can’t forget to acknowledge the incredible feat accomplished by Ryan Stonehouse as a rookie. If the Titans record reflected Stonhouse’s accomplishments, then I think this would be a different story.\nTownsend was transcended this year through the likes of team success, as Stonehouse was overshadowed by the struggle of the offense. Based on the punter percentage inside of the 20 yard-line and the net return yards per punt, the 2022 NFL punting crown must go to Tommy Townsend."
